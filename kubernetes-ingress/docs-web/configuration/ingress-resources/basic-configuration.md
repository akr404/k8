# Basic Configuration

The example below shows a basic Ingress resource definition. It load balances requests for two services -- coffee and tea -- comprising a hypothetical *cafe* app hosted at `cafe.example.com`:
```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: cafe-ingress
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - cafe.example.com
    secretName: cafe-secret
  rules:
  - host: cafe.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /tea
        backend:
          serviceName: tea-svc
          servicePort: 80
      - path: /coffee
        backend:
          serviceName: coffee-svc
          servicePort: 80
```

Here is a breakdown of what this Ingress resource definition means:
* The `metadata.name` field defines the name of the resource `cafe‑ingress`.
* In the `spec.tsl` field we set up SSL/TLS termination:
    * In the `secretName`, we reference a secret resource by its name, `cafe‑secret`. This resource contains the SSL/TLS certificate and key and it must be deployed prior to the Ingress resource.
    * In the `hosts` field, we apply the certificate and key to our `cafe.example.com` host.
* In the `spec.rules` field, we define a host with domain name `cafe.example.com`.
* In the `paths` field, we define two path‑based rules:
  * The rule with the path `/tea` instructs NGINX to distribute the requests with the `/tea` URI among the pods of the *tea* service, which is deployed with the name `tea‑svc` in the cluster.
  * The rule with the path `/coffee` instructs NGINX to distribute the requests with the `/coffee` URI among the pods of the *coffee* service, which is deployed with the name `coffee‑svc` in the cluster.
  * Both rules instruct NGINX to distribute the requests to `port 80` of the corresponding service (the `servicePort` field).

> For complete instructions on deploying the Ingress and Secret resources in the cluster, see the [complete-example](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/tree/master/examples/complete-example) in our GitHub repo.

> To learn more about the Ingress resource, see the [Ingress resource documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) in the Kubernetes docs.

## Restrictions

The NGINX Ingress Controller imposes the following restrictions on Ingress resources:
* When defining an Ingress resource, the `host` field is required.
* The `host` value must be unique for each ingress resource.

## Advanced Configuration

The Ingress resource only allows you to use basic NGINX features -- host and path-based routing and TLS termination. Advanced features like rewriting the request URI or inserting additional response headers are available through annotations. See the [Advanced Configuration with Annotations](/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/ingress-resources/advanced-configuration-with-annotations) doc.
